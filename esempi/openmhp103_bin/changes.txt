4.11.2004 	org.dvb.ui.DVBGraphicsImpl added createGraphics(Graphics2D g)

26.10.2004	interface org.openmhp.adaptation.graphics.ApplicationImageProvider

1.0.2 --------- release 1.10.2004
		256 fully implemented classes
		99 partially implemented classes
		72 not implemented classes

29.9.2004	Added checkbox that can be used to select to use own jpegs as a background image.
		If the checkbox is not selected, the default background image is shown, IF there
		is no iframe-conversion program selected.
		
		User has to use Java compliant image formats, such as JPG, GIF and PNG. If you have
		set convert.exe's application path and selected to use own background images, an
		nullpointer error will occur. 
		
		Added additional classpath configuration window. Select File > Configure and select
		from the opened window tab named Classpath.
		
		User can now set additional classpath if needed. The additional classpath is added
		to the classpath of each launched xlet. 

28.9.2004	IFrame conversion program can be now set from the Application Manager. Select
		File > Configure and select from the opened window tab named IFrames. Use browse
		button to locate the Imagemagick's executable 'convert'.
			
		Changed org.havi.ui.HBackgroundImage to try IFrame conversion only if conversion
		program is set by user.

15.9.2004	Created CATVRCInterface and implemented some methods RCInterfaceManager.
		Fixed another bug in the VideoLayer. Before fix the video was not shown, if
		the video was first scaled down and then scaled back with scaling factors (1,1).

7.9.2004	Made some changes to org.dvb.net.rc.RCInterfaceManager. The class is still partially
		implemented.


6.9.2004	Fixed problem with test image (video). A bug was reported that causes MHPTester to 
		show only white screen. The reason is the replacement of java.awt.Graphics with
		org.dvb.ui.DVBGraphics.
		TODO: Check painting problem with DVBGraphicsImpl


25.8.2004	Implemented a functionality that checks if the application has used colors outside of the MHP
		palette. This is a fast hack, so it might get more speed in the future. Press right mouse button
		over the application window, and select "Check non-MHP colors". Every pixel with non-MHP color
		will be set to bright green.


24.8.2004	Implemented Info window for TVScreen. Now user can open a info window from the floating menu
		that opens by clicking the right mouse button. User can see the current mouse position,
		decimal color value from current pixel, hex color value from current pixel and if mouse is dragged
		the selected region size.
		

22.6.2004	Implemented a small example application for presenting colors. The application will paint a colorful
		rectangle with thousands of colors. You can see how the colors are reduced by selecting the paint mode
		"MHP palette".
	
		Implemented org.openmhp.util.MHPPaletteUtil which can be used to convert colors to
		MHP palette.

		Implemented a method that sets org.dvb.ui.DVBGraphicsImpl in to paletted or non-paletted state.
		In a paletted state, all setColor() calls are checked with MHPPaletteUtil. This results graphics
		to be painted with MHP palette.
		Palette or non-palette mode can be changed by clicking right mouse button over application window.
		Palette selector popup was implemented to the class org.openmhp.system.TVScreen.
		TODO: move org.dvb.ui.DVBGraphicsImpl in to the correct package!
		TODO: convert images to MHP palette

21.6.2004	Implemented Configuration window. Window can be opened from Appman's menubar. At the moment, nothing
		can be configured.

14.6.2004	Fixed resize bug in org.havi.ui.HStillImageBackgroundConfiguration
		
		Fixed bug in looping UserEvents in org.dvb.event.EventManager
		
		Added paint method to HContainer. It seems that if the super.paint(g) is called
		in a direct child of AWT-component, the used DVBGraphics object disappears. This results
		in ClassCastException when trying to use DVBGraphics methods in child component's
		paint-method.

		

--------- 1.0.1

28.5.2004	I have implemented a simple system that reads a EIT-information file
		captured with DVBSnoop. This is just a test, and I think I will comment
		it our from the release. You can turn it on from org.openmhp.system.MHPDevice, lines 91-92.

13.5.2004	Started to implement SIDatabase and other org.dvb.si-classes.

28.4.2004	Changed SubtitleLayer to do repaint only if subtitles are on.
		Subtitles are now optional. You can start and stop subtitles from application manager's properties tab. 

15.4.2004	org.havi.ui.HSound is implemented.
			FIXME: Method set(byte[] data) is still a hack.

14.4.2004	Found and fixed bug that slows down Java and your whole workstation. 
			AWTVideoSizeControl and BackgroundVideoPresentationControl
			both are now working properly.

5.4.2004	Mapped HRcCapabilities, HKeyCapabilities and HEventRepresentation through adaptation layer.
			Adaptation layer has now class org.openmhp.adaptation.event.HEventCapabilities which describes
			supported remote control and keyboard event. 
			TODO: remove events that are not supported with current remote control graphics

--------- 1.0

19.3.2004	Created src and bin packages for distribution.
			TODO: still problems with classpaths

17.3.2004	Adding subtitles resulted errors in repaint.
			TODO: check painting DONE: 28.4.2004
			TODO: make subtitles optional in Appman DONE: 28.4.2004

16.3.2004	Namespace changed to org.openmhp.
			Today there are 21948 lines of code (comments included).

12.3.2004	Checked some classes for errors.
			Created subtitles for SubtitleLayer.
			Created SubtitlingLanguageControl that controls SubtitleLayer.

7.3.2004	Current statistics:
			87 not implemented classes
			77 partially implemented classes
			232 fully implemented classes
			---
			396 inspected classes together

3.3.2004	Wrote user guide, faq, history, known bugs and technical

2.3.2004	Updated filenames and removed unused classes, images and text files.
			Wrote guides for downloading and installation.

1.3.2004	New Application Manager.

25.2.2004	Added variables in com.axel.mhp.system.Constants

24.2.2004	Added mechanism for setting classloader info on or off.

13.2.2004
		Last three days I have looked through interfaces, events and exceptions. Many, but not all
		of them are implemented.
		Current statistics:
			in org-packages there are 273 inspected classes (140 not inspected)
			from inspected classes there are 
			212 fully implemented
			31 partially implemented and
			30 not implemented classes
		It means that more than half of the org-classes can be implemented internally (within core java).
		At the moment there are 14881 lines of code in org-packages (comments are included).
		org.havi.ui.event-package almost ready, mappings to the adaptation layer are missing
			TODO: create object that describes platform capabilities


11.2.2004	Added method printMe(int type) to com.axel.mhp.system.Out
			Method prints its type, class and method to system out.
			Method does not need any specific arguments, the method finds
			out who was the calling class and method.
			FIXME: Change the code so that Exception is thrown only when needed

10.2.2004 	DVBClassLoader implemented
			DVBClassLoaderImpl implemented, classes are not tested but the classloader itself should work.
			FIXME: Currently no security checks
			
			UserEvents are added to org.dvb.event.EventManager,method fireUserEvent is fixed.
			FIXME: In some cases events are not passed, check how it should be done.
