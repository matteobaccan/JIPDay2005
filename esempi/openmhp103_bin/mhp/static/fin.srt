Hello

2
00:03:08,400  -->  00:03:10,200
Hi

3
00:03:11,200  -->  00:03:12,700
How are you?

4
00:03:14,000  -->  00:03:16,000
I am fine, thanks.
And you?

5
00:03:16,500  -->  00:03:18,600
I am fine too.

6
00:03:23,700  -->  00:03:24,700
Are you busy?

7
00:03:25,000  -->  00:03:26,000
Yes, a bit.

8
00:03:26,200  -->  00:03:27,200
Well...

9
00:03:27,800  -->  00:03:28,800
Then I will not bother you

10
00:03:29,000  -->  00:03:30,100
Oh, it is okay.

11
00:03:30,300  -->  00:03:31,900
Tell me what is on your mind.

12
00:03:40,200  -->  00:03:41,200
If it is ok?

13
00:03:43,100  -->  00:03:44,700
Yes, it is.

14
00:03:45,000  -->  00:03:47,300
Really?

15
00:03:48,800  -->  00:03:50,600
Please...

16
00:03:52,800  -->  00:03:55,100
Oh ok.
How do you turn these off?

17
00:04:01,100  -->  00:04:02,600
Oh, the subtitles?

18
00:04:04,600  -->  00:04:07,700
Yes.

19
00:04:10,600  -->  00:04:11,700
You have to get a control
component and use it

20
00:04:14,900  -->  00:04:16,200
What component?

21
00:04:24,000  -->  00:04:25,900
SubtitlingLanguageControl

22
00:04:27,000  -->  00:04:28,800
What is that?

23
00:04:30,100  -->  00:04:31,900
It can be used to select
language for subtitles

24
00:04:33,800  -->  00:04:36,200
This is new for me

25
00:04:39,300  -->  00:04:41,100
Subtitles are used in some
countries

26
00:04:45,900  -->  00:04:48,100
Oh... that is strange

27
00:04:54,100  -->  00:04:57,500
No, actually it is quite
useful

28
00:04:58,200  -->  00:05:01,100
If you say so

29
00:05:01,900  -->  00:05:03,700
Yes...

30
00:05:04,000  -->  00:05:05,400
So...

31
00:05:07,500  -->  00:05:09,000
How can I turn these off?

32
00:05:11,900  -->  00:05:13,600
You have to find a reference

33
00:05:45,700  -->  00:05:48,200
to a ServiceContext.

34
00:05:53,100  -->  00:05:54,500
And then?

35
00:05:50,400  -->  00:05:52,000
Use method
getServiceContentHandlers()

36
00:05:53,300  -->  00:05:54,500
to find out what controls
can be found

37
00:06:32,800  -->  00:06:35,400
Then select control
SubtitlingLanguageControl

38
00:06:38,800  -->  00:06:40,400
And...

39
00:07:46,400  -->  00:07:47,900
Then you can use it's
methods

40
00:07:51,200  -->  00:07:52,500
For example what?

41
00:08:04,700  -->  00:08:06,700
You can ask if the subtitles
are on

42
00:08:59,100  -->  00:09:00,600
You can call
isSubtitlingOn

43
00:09:10,300  -->  00:09:13,100
or you can call
listAvailableLanguages()

44
00:09:14,600  -->  00:09:16,300
Oh, I see.

45
00:10:32,400  -->  00:10:34,000
And how about stopping the
subtitles?

46
00:10:35,000  -->  00:10:36,400
You can call setSubtitling

47
00:10:55,400  -->  00:10:57,000
Use boolean value to
set it on or off

48
00:11:01,600  -->  00:11:06,300
You know, true if you want
them on

49
00:11:07,900  -->  00:11:09,600
and false, if you
want them off.

50
00:11:10,100  -->  00:11:15,400
Okay.
I have to try that.

51
00:11:17,500  -->  00:11:19,400
Remember!

52
00:11:19,900  -->  00:11:21,800
What?

53
00:11:29,700  -->  00:11:31,300
Remember to turn it back on

54
00:11:31,600  -->  00:11:33,400
when your application
is done!

55
00:11:34,100  -->  00:11:36,300
I'll try to remember!

56
00:11:36,700  -->  00:11:38,300
This text will

57
00:11:41,100  -->  00:11:42,200
end

58
00:11:42,500  -->  00:11:45,800
soon.

59
00:11:47,400  -->  00:11:48,600


60
00:11:51,700  -->  00:11:52,400
